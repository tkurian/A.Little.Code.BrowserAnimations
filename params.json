{"body":"# Browser Animations\r\n## High-Level Description\r\n\r\n### CSS\r\nEverything with an animation uses the animate.css library. I also used this file to position all the objects in appropriate places. \r\n\r\n### HTML/JAVASCRIPT\r\nUnlike the other web based application I write, I did not separate the javascript from the html. However, this would be fairly easy to do. The reason why I decided to keep it all in one place was simply for convenience. \r\n\r\n#### HTML\r\nThis portion of the code uses a combination of <div></div> and <a></a>. It either places objects into divs or sets up the image links and events. \r\n\r\n#### JAVASCRIPT\r\nJavascript handles a few things in this application. First off, it handles swapping the box image. To cause the box to appear as though it's opening, we need both an open-box image and a closed-box image. When the mouse hovers over the closed-box, the opened-box image should replace it. Javascript is also used to launch the animate.css code for the animations to appear on specific events - the onclick event in this particular application.
